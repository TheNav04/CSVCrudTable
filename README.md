# CSVCrudTable
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand server-side JavaScript, file handling, and client-server communication. 


# Functionality 
This is a basic Node.js server that reads data from a CSV file and allows a client to:
  1) View CSV data
  2) Add new entries
  3) Update existing entries
  4) Remove entries

# Features
1) Parses and serves CSV data
2) Accepts client-side updates, deletions, and insertions
3) Simple REST-style API

# Prerequisites
1) Node.js

# Disclaimer
This is an early-stage learning project. The code may be rough and not production-ready. It's a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a better JavaScript developer. 
The code is messy but the functionality is there.
